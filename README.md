# 🍋 Little Lemon Restaurant — HTML & CSS Starter Site

Welcome to **Little Lemon**, a simple restaurant webpage built with foundational HTML and CSS.  
This project is part of my learning journey in web development, and serves as both a technical artifact and a ritual offering.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5 — semantic structure and content
- CSS3 — styling and layout
- JavaScript — interactivity
- GitHub Pages — deployment
- Visual Studio Code (via Codespaces)

## 🌿 Ritual Invocation
> _“This menu is a blessing. Each dish is a legacy.  
> I honour the hands that feed and the ancestors who guide.”_
