# Copilot Instructions for Code Reviews

Welcome to the **little-lemon-site** repository! These instructions are here to help Copilot and human reviewers provide effective, consistent, and context-aware code reviews tailored to this project.

## Project Overview

- **Description**: HTML & CSS restaurant site with poetic and ancestral motifs.
- **Languages**: 
  - HTML (76.9%)
  - CSS (17.9%)
  - JavaScript (5.2%)

---

## Code Review Guidelines

### 1. HTML

- Ensure semantic HTML is used for accessibility and SEO.
- Use clear, descriptive tag structure. Prefer `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc., where appropriate.
- Verify that poetic/ancestral motifs are expressed through meaningful structure and content, not just visuals.

### 2. CSS

- Maintain consistent naming conventions (BEM or another system if used).
- Prefer external stylesheets over inline styles.
- Check for responsive designâ€”site should display well on mobile and desktop.
- Ensure visual motifs (colors, fonts, patterns) align with the poetic and ancestral themes.

### 3. JavaScript

- Use JavaScript sparingly and only to enhance interactivity (since it is a small part of the project).
- Ensure scripts degrade gracefully if JS is disabled.
- Keep code modular and well-commented.

## Project-Specific Instructions

- **Motifs**: Code and content should reflect poetic and ancestral themes, especially in UI elements and copy.
- **Accessibility**: Always check for alt attributes on images, proper ARIA roles, and keyboard navigability.
- **Performance**: Avoid heavy scripts or large assets that could slow down the site.
- **Content**: Ensure any text or motifs do not unintentionally misrepresent cultural or poetic references.
